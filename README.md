# Switch Codex

Switch Codex is a personal project exploring the history, design, and evolution of mechanical keyboard switches, with a focus on Cherry MX and Alps.

My interest in mechanical and vintage keyboards led me to explore the historical and technical significance of these two switch designs, which became the foundation for this project.
